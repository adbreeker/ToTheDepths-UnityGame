  **Simple arcade game and my first Unity project**
</div>

## About
This is my 1st Unity project, first game developed and deployed by me.

A simple underwater arcade game featuring two game modes inspired by classics of this genre. Dive deep into the ocean depths, collect treasure, and test your skills in this action-packed mobile experience.

The game includes two distinct game modes that offer different challenges and gameplay mechanics. Start with the Dive In mode where you'll use your device's gyroscope to navigate through dangerous waters, then unlock the Submarine mode after collecting 25 coins to explore even deeper underwater caverns.

## Game Modes

**1. Dive In**
- Tilt your phone to move the scuba diver
- Avoid planks and piranhas
- Collect coins and beat your records

**2. Submarine**
- Hold finger to go up, release to go down
- Avoid stalactites and stalagmites
- Collect coins and toolboxes (healing)
- 3-hit health system

## What I've Learnt
- Basics of C# and Unity
- Simple 2D movement and gyroscope integration
- Managing screen resolution and orientation
- Basic sound and scene management
- Implementing rewarded ads with Unity Ads (legacy)
- Deploying to the Google Play Store

## Built With
Unity & C#
